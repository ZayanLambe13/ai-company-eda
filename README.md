# Exploratory Data Analysis of AI Companies

## Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of AI companies
to understand trends in company types, product domains, founding timelines,
staffing, usage, funding, and overall ecosystem growth.

The goal of this project is to derive meaningful insights from data before applying
any machine learning models.

## Datasets
The analysis uses the following datasets:
- AI company metadata
- Staff reports
- Usage reports


All datasets are stored in the `data/` directory.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
- VS Code
- Git & GitHub

## Key Analysis Performed
- Distribution of AI company types
- Product domain analysis (Language, Video, etc.)
- Founding year trends in AI companies
- Workforce and usage overview
- Business insights from funding and growth patterns

## Key Insights
- A significant rise in AI company formation is observed after 2020

- AI companies show large variation in scale, funding, and usage

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the notebook in `notebooks/ai_eda.ipynb`
3. Ensure required Python libraries are installed
4. Run all cells to reproduce the analysis

## Future Work
